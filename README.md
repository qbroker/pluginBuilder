## Build TiddlyWiki classic plugins with ease

This TiddlyWiki classic gives you the templates to build plugins based on templates.

The plugin source code can be:
- edited with ace.js editor, that is included as plugin

- transpiled with babel, that is included as plugin

- minified with terser, that is included as plugin

This TiddlyWiki is modified to have a nice look and feel in NW.js, but it will work in the browser too.

If you like to contribute or like to propose improvements drop them here:https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywikiclassic

```
** The plugin is EXPERIMENTAL AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE **
```


Have a nice day, Okido
