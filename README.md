Build TiddlyWiki classic plugins with ease

This TiddlyWiki classic gives you the templates to build plugins based on templates.
The plugin source code can be:
# edited with the included ace.js editor
# transpiled with babel also included
# the pluging code can be minified with terser

This TiddlyWiki is modified to have a nice look and feel in NW.js, but it will work in the browser too.

Have a nice day, Okido
